                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>There aren't many known organisms of SUB-DC127, and the closest related species so far has been
                    determined to be ambition and desire.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The few organisms that have been studied were found in a location known as "Dreamscape".</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The shape of its body appears to conjugate randomly in a spiral-like pattern, with its main parts
                    being comprised
                    of a bright green rectangular shape that fluctuates in width and height. It is very difficult to
                    study up close,
                    as any close physical proximity seems to trigger a defense mechanism where SUB-DC127 enters an
                    spectral state.
                    When it is in this state, it is difficult to see with the human eye and almost impossible to
                    initiate physical
                    contact. SUB-DC127 rarely sleeps but when it does, it enters its spectral state and ceases its
                    trajectory.
                    However, its body continues to conjugate itself.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter</li>
                    <li>its white spine can be seen when its main body parts are relatively small</li>
                    <li>seems to have an appetite, but doesn't eat anything</li>
                    <li>has a constant, consistent trajectory that doesn't seem to go anywhere</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about SUB-DC127:</span>
                Originally thought to be independent creatures, recent studies have shown that species of SUB-DC127 form
                an attachment to people who attempt contact. Though it will not allow actual physical contact, SUB-DC127
                will stay in the approximate area of the person of interest indefinitely (studies are still on-going).
                It does not to seem to be a sentient organism, but it does appear to respond to positive verbal
                affirmations concerning an individual's goals in life.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with SUB-DC127:</span> There isn't much
                information as of now on human interaction. All that has been discovered from experiments and studies is
                that any attempt to grab or hold SUB-DC127 results in an almost complete invisible state. However, it
                appears to become agitated when 20,000 Hz of sound is released in its proximity (around 60 inch radius).
