    <h1>SUBJECT A: Dream Chaser</h1>
    <h3>Code Name:</h3>
    <p>SUB-DC127</p>
    <h3>Discovered by / at:</h3>
    <p>Bibi Ha, discovered October 4, 2024 at 1:27PM CST</p>
    <h3>Family:</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Habitat:</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Appearance:</h3>
    <p>The shape of its body appears to conjugate randomly in a spiral-like pattern, with its main parts being comprised
        of a bright green rectangular shape that fluctuates in width and height. It is very difficult to study up close,
        as any close physical proximity seems to trigger a defense mechanism where SUB-DC127 enters an spectral state.
        When it is in this state, it is difficult to see with the human eye and almost impossible to initiate physical
        contact. SUB-DC127 rarely sleeps but when it does, it enters its spectral state and ceases its trajectory.
        However, its body continues to conjugate itself. </p>
    <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
    * about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter
    * its long white spine can be seen when its main body parts are relatively small
    * the color of its main body parts are always the same bright green
